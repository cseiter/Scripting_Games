	.SYNOPSIS
		Get info from local/remote computer about PC name and OS/BIOS version
	
	.DESCRIPTION
		Write a one-liner that produces the following output:
		PSComputerName	ServicePackMajorVersion	Version	BIOSSerial
		--------------	-----------------------	-------	----------
		
	.Notes
		--Try not to use more than 1 semi-colon.
		--Try not to use ForEach loops.
		--Write the command to target multiple computers if desired.
		
		I used the WMI search Utility from symantec to make sure I was getting
		the correct GWMI class for my script.  I couldn't find one that had both
		so I had to figure how to combine them into one.  Following the page here,
		http://learningpcs.blogspot.com/2011/08/powershell-expressions.html, showed
		me how to build "code within code" to keep it a one-liner.  I don't have
		multiple computers to run this against so I can't test remote capabilities.
		I do know, however, that what's inside the parentheses gets evaluated first,
		so there's hope.
